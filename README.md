# School Grading System (Python)

This project is a basic school grading system written in Python. It uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to assign grades based on student scores.

## Features

- Accepts user input for student score (0–100)
- Returns a grade based on the score:
  - A: 90–100
  - B: 80–89
  - C: 70–79
  - D: 60–69
  - E: 50-59
  - F: Below 50
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a student's score.
2. The program checks the score using `if-elif-else` logic.
3. The corresponding grade is printed.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- VS Code (for writing and testing)
